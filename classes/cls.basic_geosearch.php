Usage:
	See http://www.lightrod.org/  'Getting Started' section for the most up-to-date instructions.
	See http://www.lightrod.org/mediawiki/index.php/Layar_API  to create a Layar.


	Create a table with your points, and latitude, longitude, e.g. tbl_points (int_point_id, dec_latitude, dec_longitude).
			Note: You can use any field/table names
	Add four 32-bit integer columns called e.g. int_peano1, int_peano2, int_peano1iv, int_peano2iv. (or any alternative names)
	Add multi-column indexes to your table on (int_peano1, int_point_id)
							(int_peano2, int_point_id)
							(int_peano1iv, int_point_id)
							(int_peano2iv, int_point_id)

	Generate the peano codes before searching against the table (this can be done each time a new entry is added, or once at the beginning):

	require("cls.basic_geosearch.php");
	$bg = new clsBasicGeosearch();
	$peano1 = $bg->generate_peano1($latitude, $longitude);		//Lat/lon of point in table
	$peano2 = $bg->generate_peano2($latitude, $longitude);
	$peano1iv = $bg->generate_peano_iv($peano1);
	$peano2iv = $bg->generate_peano_iv($peano2);

	(and then write values back into the table).



	Then carry out a search using the following example:

** Most basic use **


	$params = array('latitude' => 50.00,			//Latitude in decimal degrees of center of search eg. 50.554345 (-90.0 to 90.0)
			'longitude' => 120.00,			//Longitude in decimal degrees of center of search eg. 20.554345 (-180.0 to 180.0)
			'table_name' => "tbl_points",		//Main table name that is being searched on e.g. 'tbl_my_points'
			'id_field' => "int_point_id",		//Unique reference to each point in the table e.g. 'int_point_id'
			'latitude_field' => "dec_latitude",	//Field in table that has the latitude in decimal for each point e.g. 50.554345
			'longitude_field' => "dec_longitude",	//Field in table that has the longitude in decimal for each point e.g. 20.554345
			'peano_field_header' => "int_peano"	//First letters of fields in table that hold peano integers
				 				//E.g. 'int_peano', which gets appended to create 'int_peano1,
				 				//int_peano2, int_peano1iv, int_peano2iv'
			);


	$results_array = $bg->proximity_finder($params);


	Returned values
	--------------

	$results_array[]			- the list of results and the included fields

	foreach($results_array as $result) {
		echo $result['int_point_id'] . ", Dist: " . $result['dist'] .  ", Lat: " . $result['latitude'] . ", Lon: " . $result['longitude'] . "<br>";
	}




	Additional Return Fields
	------------------------  (Optional, if 'provide_count' => true)

	For a search such as:

	$params = array( [...fields here...]
			'provide_count' => true
			);

	list($results_array, $count) = $bg->proximity_finder($params);

	Returns:

	$count['next_record_group']		- value to give $first_record on a 'More results' link
	$count['previous_record_group']		- value to give $first_record on a 'Previous results' link

	$count['coarse_matches']		- if $provide_count = true, total number of matches, approximation
						- uses $whole_data_dist and $max_total_results
	$count['show_next']			- true or false, for showing a 'More Results' link
	$count['show_previous']			- true or false, for showing a 'Previous Results' link


** See more complex usage below **


Notes:

Generates "peano-codes" from latitude and longitude coordinates.  Peano codes are points on a space filling curve.
  For technical information try a map text book such as "Elements of Cartography".
  The Mobilemaps nearby-engine uses peano-codes to perform a highly scalable proximity sort.
  Because one space filling curve can be very inaccurate by itself, Mobilemaps makes use of two separate curves,
  these are accessed by generate_peano1, and generate_peano2, which is a similar curve with a somewhat arbitrary x/y offset.


Note: this differs because PHP doesn't support 32-bit unsigned integers, so a string is returned if the value is negative.
  The returned values can still be inserted into an unsigned int database table, or used in a SQL string for comparisons, as if
  they were an integer.  32-bit is the prefered format to give enough accuracy to be useful.

Original code:
Geo-Mobilemaps-GeoparserLite
