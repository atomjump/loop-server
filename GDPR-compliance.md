# GDPR Compliance Project

For European users, this GDPR project and the GDPR branch aim to review and ensure AtomJump is compliant with the new EU privacy 
laws coming into effect tomorrow (25 May 2018). We have only recently become aware of the requirements, and are now 
exploring what we need to do, if anything, to the AtomJump Messaging open source project and AtomJump.com.

A preliminary look has suggested that anything traceable to the name of a person should be obscured within the database.
